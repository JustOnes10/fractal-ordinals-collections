As a new artist, I’ve always found myself captivated by the small, silent expressions that speak louder than words. There’s something mesmerizing about watching people, studying the subtle shifts in their gaze, and understanding the stories held within their eyes. For me, eyes are the windows not just to the soul, but to a world of emotions, thoughts, and experiences. This fascination with human expression, especially through the eyes, has led me to create this collection—my way of celebrating the diversity, beauty, and mystery captured in every glance.

About the Collection: Diversity of the Eyes “Diversity of the Eyes” is more than just a series of images; it’s a journey into the rich tapestry of human expression. Each piece in this collection explores a unique eye color and style, representing the countless perspectives and stories that shape our world. From deep blues and warm hazels to vibrant greens and mystical purples, each eye in this collection has its own personality, its own voice. I wanted to capture the endless variety in the human gaze, where every color tells a different story and every reflection reveals something unspoken.

Creating “Diversity of the Eyes” has been a deeply personal and rewarding experience for me, allowing me to combine my love for color, detail, and human connection. I hope that as you view each piece, you feel the same sense of wonder and curiosity that inspired me to bring these eyes to life. Through this collection, I aim to celebrate the beautiful diversity that lies within each person and each pair of eyes.
